    <h2> Team Profile </h2>
    <p><b>Team name</b><br></br>
      A team's name should be a reflection of its members, as well as the product we intend to create, and should be discussed and decided once each team member is happy to agree. No one wants to be a part of a team they are embarrassed to say the name of.
      <br></br><b> Team Profile</b><br></br>
      I believe that any good team requires open and honest communication between its members and everyone should be able to openly communicate their ideas, participate in discussions regarding the project itself and be open to constructive criticism as a means of improving the concept into a workable plan. Team members should co-operate and assume roles they are comfortable with, if they wish to learn a skill, they should not assume the full responsibility of that role, but rather a supporting role to gain a gist of how that role would work, and ask questions of interest to the member of our team who has assumed that role, this means that the next time the opportunity arises, this team member will have full knowledge of the requirements of that position, and prepared for all of the responsibilities that come with it. Our team should be made up of members with a variety of these skill sets. Not one person can be amazing at every aspect of a project, and that's okay! As long as any concerns are brought to the attention of the group, there will always be a member who is experienced in what we need done. Team members should make their skills known within our team, as well as any areas they may be lacking in. This way our team can formulate a plan, and distribute work to each member that can be completed to a high standard.
There are many aspects of work to consider when taking on a project, and a lot of the time this work goes unnoticed, such as the planning and improvement stages of the project. For any high quality product, there is a quality plan supporting it. Having a consistent workflow through the project is extremely important. No part of the project should be easy and laid back, from the planning process to the end presentation, every part should be taken as seriously as the next. I would like to form a team that understands this and agrees. During my time at RMIT I have been teamed with teams that fall into this trap, and as a result our projects didn't perform as well as I would have hoped.<br></br>
When I undergo any project, I tend to throw myself into it, thinking about it constantly until I am completely satisfied with its outcome. I want to create something that I can be proud of and would want to showcase to clients. Every member of the team should feel this way about a project, and have the confidence to stand up and present our work to everyone.
Last but not least, I would like my team members to be friendly. We don't need to be friends, but it's okay to be friendly and supportive, making sure your teammates are not over stressed and can contribute their best.

    <h2> Project Idea </h2>
    <p><h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
For my project I would like to create a character driven looter style video game, made for mobile devices and can be understood by players aged 7 and above. A looter style game consists of a hero character, controlled by the player, that progresses through different maps and defeating different enemies to gain new weapons and armour, and subsequently will be able to defeat more powerful enemy characters. I would like this game to hold an ‘open world’ game style, where the player isn't forced to follow any certain path, but instead can travel anywhere at any time and complete different side quests as well as following a main story quest. To complete quests, the player must first interact with a computer generated character, which will give a description of what whe player must do, and a glance at its available rewards, motivating the player to continue. Side quests would give less rewards, and would be easier to complete than story based quests.
</p>

<h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
<p>As previously discussed in assignment 1, I have spent the majority of my childhood entertaining myself with all kinds of video games. I enjoyed playing through each one, getting better, finding bugs and errors that the developers overlooked and seeing how far the coding can be stretched within its boundaries. I have seen the rise of many popular games, having played the famous ‘League of legends’ since its alpha version released by riot games on October 27th 2009, and another great example is the open world sandbox survival game everyone loves, Minecraft. I have played video games over all available means, console, PC and mobile games and have found common elements that draw players in to keep playing. As the game gains popularity, another common aspect of these games is to add extra content that costs a little extra, or microtransaction throughout the game to give the player more content to enjoy, as well as supporting the development process of the game's design. Even if 1 item costs $0.99 cents, if the game has a population of 1000 players and each buys this item, the game has just made $990 US dollars profit, that can be used as a motivation for people to improve the game further.
I have always wanted to design my own game, something I can also enjoy playing and adding content as I see fit, and plan to use this opportunity to build a team that has the same view.
</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, I would like to create an open world looter based game. I would like the game to follow a storyline, to keep the player intrigued as to what will happen next, but this shouldnt be the main focus of the game itself. A looter style game focuses on the player defeatings massive waves of enemies at once, using skills and items at their leisure, some good examples of games that follow this description are Diablo (1, 2, 3) and world of warcraft, both developed by Blizzard entertainment; or the new minecraft game release: Minecraft Dungeons, developed by Mojang and Microsoft and published May 26th 2020.  Enemies drop items to improve the hero’s overall stats and allow the player to defeat more difficult enemies, and progress through the map. There will be a variety of items available for the player to find, some items will have lower drop rates than others, making them hard to find, some items should be hidden, and some dropped only by high level mobs or boss characters, to motivate the player to take on more challenges. Items should also be diverse, ranging from armour upgrades, to new weapons, healing potions or food, speed boosters and so on. Items should also be given as a reward for completing quests available all over the world. To complete quests, the player must first interact with a computer generated character, which will give a description of what whe player must do, and a glance at its available rewards, motivating the player to continue. Side quests would give less rewards, and would be easier to complete than story based quests.
<br></br>
The game world can be designed and generated in unreal engine. I have used unreal engine before to create some simple 3d environments, but have never added a character or given any real purpose. In terms of graphic style, I believe that a simple style can take a long way with the right kind of content. Realistic style games take years to design, perfect and render, as well as huge teams of designers. I want to create a simplistic, entertaining mobile app that can be enjoyed for 5 minutes or for 5 hours, where players aren't forced to continue and can leave at any moment. As a student I find that I simply do not have enough time to play games anymore, as each mission or quest takes longer than I have to relax, such as ‘league of legends’, ‘Deep rock Galactic’ or ‘Skyrim’. Idle games are just as fun and do not stress the player about their overall participation, mostly moving through the games recycled content automatically while the player does their work, and doesn't pay much attention to the ‘grinding’ aspect of the game; they are mainly interested in reaping its rewards and customising their characters, a good example of a game like this is ‘Non-Stop Knights 2’ on mobile devices. This is similar to the effect I would like to create, but without the auto-play aspect of the game. I want the players to be invested in upgrading their character to the highest level they can be, finding epic armour sets and combining them to defeat more powerful bosses.
</p>

<h3>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>The main tool that I plan on developing my game in will be the aforementioned Unreal Engine version 5, developed by Epic MegaGames. Unreal engine is a diverse and powerful game engine that can render large 3d environments, as well as create interactions between characters, generated mobs and the environment itself. Characters on the other hand cannot be created in unreal engine, but can be imported from other software exports such as the 3d modelling software Blender. For this, a powerful computer is necessary to render all of these materials together, a 64-bit processing system with at least an 8th gen intel processor, or a quad processor is preferred. Direct X 12 will increase the render quality of the environment during the creation stages, but is optional; at least 8gb of ram is required otherwise the software will not be able to run.
Some experience in 3D softwares such as blender or archicad. Archicad is better for both character animations and modelling, but blender allows for more detailed modelling, and can be imported directly and animated in unreal engine.
As the character will be interacting with other characters, accepting quests and following a story line, the members of my team and I will have to create a background story for the character to follow that's intriguing enough for the player to want to find out what will happen to their character when they reach the end. Storytelling and writing skills will come into play here, and will need to be agreed upon by each member of the team before we can start designing the game itself.
</p>

<h3>SKILLS REQUIRED</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, to create this game our team will require some experience in storytelling, as well as 3d environment creation, 3d modelling and animation. Our team should also have good communication skills, as everyone's ideas should be open to criticism as well as taken into consideration. A great game doesn't just come to mind, it has to be planned, and flow like a real story. I will need teammates who are willing to sit, discuss and scrap as many ideas as it takes before we have a real vision on what to do, and all members are in agreement and proud.
</p>

<h3>OUTCOME</h3>
<p>I would like to create a free game that is generally easy to understand and fun to interact with. So many games nowadays come with a $60 Dollar price tag, and more costs to unlock exclusive content. Games are supposed to be a fun way to spend our down time, a means of escape from the stresses of reality. I used to love playing Diablo when I was younger, grinding and farming the same bosses over and over all day to unlock exclusive weapons with ridiculously low drop rates, nowadays people just buy the best items, and if you can’t, your character won't perform as well as those who have. Microtransactions shouldn’t make a game fun, the game should be fun by default, and with an extra cost you can unlock a new map or new items, but not powerful enough to surpass players who can't afford to pay those transaction fees.
<br></br>
My dream is to create a video game that anyone can play for free, interact with one another and show off their new items that they have wired hard to collect, and can discuss parts of their story line together, and how they feel about their characters in this virtual world, and debate possible endings to the story they are following.

    <h2>Peer feedback (A3 group)</h2>
    <p> My goal is to become a professional UI designer and work my way towards becoming a UX designer, and eventually open my own design studio, focusing on professional photography, video production and post production editing. It is my dream to create an environment where young creators can collaborate, share their work and provide a place for artists, and small businesses to produce their own media content at a professional level.
A UX Designer is focused on all aspects of a product's development, including design, usability, funcion, and even branding and marketing. Their work touches the entire end-to-end journey of a user's interaction with a product, and includes identifying new opportunities for the product and business.<br></br>
A UI designer is slightly different from a UX designer, they work to maximise user experience while interacting with machines and visual technology, in order to convey the information displayed simple enough for any user to understand, and create a pleasurable experience.<br></br>
User Interface designers design interfaces for machines and user software, in order to maximise the usability of an application by analysing and  displaying the most important information, and build the software architecture in a way that an ordinary person can understand the visual information being conveyed. The goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing product for users to interact with without prior knowledge or training, that will leave a lasting impression.
To properly accomplish these tasks, UI Designers must understand the basic design principles of user interface and experience design. Knowledge in design softwares is a must as designers must be able to create wireframe and prototype designs of the proposed product or design style to their client, to ensure both the designer and their client can agree on every aspect of the design or discuss any changes that should be made. Over the course of any project, designers will work closely with their clients, as well as the target audience of the proposed product. UI designers must be comfortable communicating and collaborating with clients and the audience, and greate communicative skills to explain their proposed design, why it will work, and incorporate the clients feedback to improve the design.
User research plays an important role to UI designers, bringing real life data to analyse their design and highlight any functions that don’t work or become irrelevant, and any design improvements that must be made in order for the users to understand all of the information they intend to. According to Nilesen et al, a group of 5 different individuals will provide enough real life data to represent all user groups. Once 5 individuals are selected, they are given a prototype of the intended product and left to complete tasks. Any problems they have or comments made will be recorded and interpreted later in order to refine the design.<br></br>
As a media student and aspiring UI designer, I love working and collaborating with different artists and clients to produce a variety of different products. I am able to incorporate different design elements to work together to communicate visual information to the user in an efficient manner, and practice these skills regularly by designing concept products in wireframe softwares. I am able to analyse why an existing product isn't designed in the best way, and critique the reasons why, and use these reasons to improve the design using different prototyping tools, and testing the design using user research to test the improvements against real world user data.<br></br>
There are a few more skills I need to acquire before I can start working as a professional. As a student of design, you learn all of the principles that should be followed in order to create an appealing design, but learning the principles and really understanding them are two separate things. I need to complete my portfolio, in order to show clients examples of my past works, and advertise my skills in a visual way. I need to refine my understanding of information architecture in interactive design, and decipher which information should be included and what information is irrelevant. <br></br>
I should also refine my skills in user empathy. As a design student, I spend the majority of my time online, or using technology. Some users do not have the level of understanding towards technology as I have developed, and may struggle to find information that is not obvious in ways that I may think of. I need to step back and look at my designs at face value, in order to understand how the user will see the design at first glance.
After completing my degree in design, I intend to apply for an internship at a design company located in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam to gain real work experience in this field, with the intention of working to be promoted into their design team. I feel that working with professionals in real world environments is the best way to really see what an effective designer can do, and how they should interact casually with clients, while keeping everything professional and focused at the same time.
After I have worked in this field and saved some money to my name, I intend on starting my own design studio. To accomplish this, I will have to learn business management skills, and work to advertise my business towards its target audience.
