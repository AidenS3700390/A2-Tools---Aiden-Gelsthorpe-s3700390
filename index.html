    <h2> Team Profile </h2>
    <p><b>Team name</b><br></br>
      A team's name should be a reflection of its members, as well as the product we intend to create, and should be discussed and decided once each team member is happy to agree. No one wants to be a part of a team they are embarrassed to say the name of.
      <br></br><b> Team Profile</b><br></br>
      I believe that any good team requires open and honest communication between its members and everyone should be able to openly communicate their ideas, participate in discussions regarding the project itself and be open to constructive criticism as a means of improving the concept into a workable plan. Team members should co-operate and assume roles they are comfortable with, if they wish to learn a skill, they should not assume the full responsibility of that role, but rather a supporting role to gain a gist of how that role would work, and ask questions of interest to the member of our team who has assumed that role, this means that the next time the opportunity arises, this team member will have full knowledge of the requirements of that position, and prepared for all of the responsibilities that come with it. Our team should be made up of members with a variety of these skill sets. Not one person can be amazing at every aspect of a project, and that's okay! As long as any concerns are brought to the attention of the group, there will always be a member who is experienced in what we need done. Team members should make their skills known within our team, as well as any areas they may be lacking in. This way our team can formulate a plan, and distribute work to each member that can be completed to a high standard. 
There are many aspects of work to consider when taking on a project, and a lot of the time this work goes unnoticed, such as the planning and improvement stages of the project. For any high quality product, there is a quality plan supporting it. Having a consistent workflow through the project is extremely important. No part of the project should be easy and laid back, from the planning process to the end presentation, every part should be taken as seriously as the next. I would like to form a team that understands this and agrees. During my time at RMIT I have been teamed with teams that fall into this trap, and as a result our projects didn't perform as well as I would have hoped.<br></br>
When I undergo any project, I tend to throw myself into it, thinking about it constantly until I am completely satisfied with its outcome. I want to create something that I can be proud of and would want to showcase to clients. Every member of the team should feel this way about a project, and have the confidence to stand up and present our work to everyone.
Last but not least, I would like my team members to be friendly. We don't need to be friends, but it's okay to be friendly and supportive, making sure your teammates are not over stressed and can contribute their best.

    <h2> Interests in the IT industry </h2>
    <p>My interests in Information technology lay mostly with user interactions with softwares and digital products. I always find reasons to criticize the mediums I use and am convinced they could have been designed in a more elegant way, that would also make them easier to use for people of all technological skill ranges, but cinema production and video game production and design also peek my interest as I spent a lot of my early life surrounded by video games and different movies from different times. I have always had a profound respect for digital artists and the work that they create to illustrate stories and create new worlds in the minds of the audience.<br></br>
My interest for UI and UX design grew deeper as I began to study the intricacies of user interactions with digital interfaces, and how designers use the rules of design to give the user  the best possible experience. It was only when I underwent the User Centered Design course, that I realised that this was something I enormously enjoyed, from both a design aspect, and from working with users to test prototypes and gaining feedback for improvements. With modern humans growing dependency on technology, and the evolution of aesthetic digital design layouts that still focus on usability, this industry needs new designs and ideas to help integrate new technologies into modern society.<br></br>
Before undertaking the Digital Media course at the RMIT university Vietnam, I have had little professional experience within the IT industry, apart from some basic computer science and ICT classes in high school. Since I have begun to enjoy working within this industry more and more, I realise that this is the direction I want my life to lead.<br></br>
Joining RMIT university wasn't always my plan. After I graduated high school, I had been given an offer to study earth sciences at both Brighton and Plymouth Universities (Both located in England), but as the date for me to leave came closer and closer, I questioned whether that was the right choice for me. My family had decided to stay in Vietnam after I had left and after some consideration, I respectfully declined my offers and took a gap year to travel, and figure out what I wanted to do.
When I joined RMIT, I had little to no experience in art or design. RMIT has provided me with the knowledge and skills to create my own media, share my own thoughts and feelings through artistic expression , how to seek out clients and work with them on new projects, as well as collaboration skills with other design students and professionals and taught me the basic rules and required skills for all aspects of digital creation.

    <h2> My ideal Job</h2>
    <p> My goal is to become a professional UI designer and work my way towards becoming a UX designer, and eventually open my own design studio, focusing on professional photography, video production and post production editing. It is my dream to create an environment where young creators can collaborate, share their work and provide a place for artists, and small businesses to produce their own media content at a professional level.
A UX Designer is focused on all aspects of a product's development, including design, usability, funcion, and even branding and marketing. Their work touches the entire end-to-end journey of a user's interaction with a product, and includes identifying new opportunities for the product and business.<br></br>
A UI designer is slightly different from a UX designer, they work to maximise user experience while interacting with machines and visual technology, in order to convey the information displayed simple enough for any user to understand, and create a pleasurable experience.<br></br>
User Interface designers design interfaces for machines and user software, in order to maximise the usability of an application by analysing and  displaying the most important information, and build the software architecture in a way that an ordinary person can understand the visual information being conveyed. The goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing product for users to interact with without prior knowledge or training, that will leave a lasting impression.
To properly accomplish these tasks, UI Designers must understand the basic design principles of user interface and experience design. Knowledge in design softwares is a must as designers must be able to create wireframe and prototype designs of the proposed product or design style to their client, to ensure both the designer and their client can agree on every aspect of the design or discuss any changes that should be made. Over the course of any project, designers will work closely with their clients, as well as the target audience of the proposed product. UI designers must be comfortable communicating and collaborating with clients and the audience, and greate communicative skills to explain their proposed design, why it will work, and incorporate the clients feedback to improve the design.
User research plays an important role to UI designers, bringing real life data to analyse their design and highlight any functions that donâ€™t work or become irrelevant, and any design improvements that must be made in order for the users to understand all of the information they intend to. According to Nilesen et al, a group of 5 different individuals will provide enough real life data to represent all user groups. Once 5 individuals are selected, they are given a prototype of the intended product and left to complete tasks. Any problems they have or comments made will be recorded and interpreted later in order to refine the design.<br></br>
As a media student and aspiring UI designer, I love working and collaborating with different artists and clients to produce a variety of different products. I am able to incorporate different design elements to work together to communicate visual information to the user in an efficient manner, and practice these skills regularly by designing concept products in wireframe softwares. I am able to analyse why an existing product isn't designed in the best way, and critique the reasons why, and use these reasons to improve the design using different prototyping tools, and testing the design using user research to test the improvements against real world user data.<br></br>
There are a few more skills I need to acquire before I can start working as a professional. As a student of design, you learn all of the principles that should be followed in order to create an appealing design, but learning the principles and really understanding them are two separate things. I need to complete my portfolio, in order to show clients examples of my past works, and advertise my skills in a visual way. I need to refine my understanding of information architecture in interactive design, and decipher which information should be included and what information is irrelevant. <br></br>
I should also refine my skills in user empathy. As a design student, I spend the majority of my time online, or using technology. Some users do not have the level of understanding towards technology as I have developed, and may struggle to find information that is not obvious in ways that I may think of. I need to step back and look at my designs at face value, in order to understand how the user will see the design at first glance.
After completing my degree in design, I intend to apply for an internship at a design company located in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam to gain real work experience in this field, with the intention of working to be promoted into their design team. I feel that working with professionals in real world environments is the best way to really see what an effective designer can do, and how they should interact casually with clients, while keeping everything professional and focused at the same time.
After I have worked in this field and saved some money to my name, I intend on starting my own design studio. To accomplish this, I will have to learn business management skills, and work to advertise my business towards its target audience.
