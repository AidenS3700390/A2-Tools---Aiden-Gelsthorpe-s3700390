    <h2> Personal statement </h2>
    <p> I am a hardworking, enthusiastic student who has gained extensive knowledge about design and media creation using a variety of hardware and software to bring my ideas to life. I always want to learn more about the aesthetic eye, and how design teams create beautiful works of art for people around the world to enjoy, using  new skills I learn to refine my own technique and ability.
I was born in England and lived there until I was seven years old before moving abroad to Kazakhstan. Moving from England was a dramatic change for me, I didn't understand the language or the culture, and I realised I had a lot to learn about the world and its people, using this opportunity to learn about the different cultures and languages, and use all of these different inspirations in my own artwork. After three years in Kazakhstan, I came to Viet Nam and have lived in Ho Chi Minh city ever since, completing high school at the ABC international school, and moving on to study Digital media and Design at RMIT University Vietnam.
My previous studies include IGCSE qualifications gained at the ABC International school Vietnam, as well as A-Level qualifications in psychology, human biology and earth and humanities based geography. It was only after high school that I realised I wanted to pursue a career in the digital industry, and understand all aspects of media creation and design.
