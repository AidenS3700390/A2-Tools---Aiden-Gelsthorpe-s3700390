    <h2> Team Profile </h2>
    <p><b>Team name</b><br></br>
      A team's name should be a reflection of its members, as well as the product we intend to create, and should be discussed and decided once each team member is happy to agree. No one wants to be a part of a team they are embarrassed to say the name of.
      <br></br><b> Team Profile</b><br></br>
      I believe that any good team requires open and honest communication between its members and everyone should be able to openly communicate their ideas, participate in discussions regarding the project itself and be open to constructive criticism as a means of improving the concept into a workable plan. Team members should co-operate and assume roles they are comfortable with, if they wish to learn a skill, they should not assume the full responsibility of that role, but rather a supporting role to gain a gist of how that role would work, and ask questions of interest to the member of our team who has assumed that role, this means that the next time the opportunity arises, this team member will have full knowledge of the requirements of that position, and prepared for all of the responsibilities that come with it. Our team should be made up of members with a variety of these skill sets. Not one person can be amazing at every aspect of a project, and that's okay! As long as any concerns are brought to the attention of the group, there will always be a member who is experienced in what we need done. Team members should make their skills known within our team, as well as any areas they may be lacking in. This way our team can formulate a plan, and distribute work to each member that can be completed to a high standard.
There are many aspects of work to consider when taking on a project, and a lot of the time this work goes unnoticed, such as the planning and improvement stages of the project. For any high quality product, there is a quality plan supporting it. Having a consistent workflow through the project is extremely important. No part of the project should be easy and laid back, from the planning process to the end presentation, every part should be taken as seriously as the next. I would like to form a team that understands this and agrees. During my time at RMIT I have been teamed with teams that fall into this trap, and as a result our projects didn't perform as well as I would have hoped.<br></br>
When I undergo any project, I tend to throw myself into it, thinking about it constantly until I am completely satisfied with its outcome. I want to create something that I can be proud of and would want to showcase to clients. Every member of the team should feel this way about a project, and have the confidence to stand up and present our work to everyone.
Last but not least, I would like my team members to be friendly. We don't need to be friends, but it's okay to be friendly and supportive, making sure your teammates are not over stressed and can contribute their best.

    <h2> Project Idea </h2>
    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>For my project I would like to create a character driven looter style video game, made for mobile devices and can be understood by players aged 7 and above. A looter style game consists of a hero character, controlled by the player, that progresses through different maps and defeating different enemies to gain new weapons and armour, and subsequently will be able to defeat more powerful enemy characters. I would like this game to hold an ‘open world’ game style, where the player isn't forced to follow any certain path, but instead can travel anywhere at any time and complete different side quests as well as following a main story quest. To complete quests, the player must first interact with a computer generated character, which will give a description of what whe player must do, and a glance at its available rewards, motivating the player to continue. Side quests would give less rewards, and would be easier to complete than story based quests.
</p>

<h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
<p>As previously discussed in assignment 1, I have spent the majority of my childhood entertaining myself with all kinds of video games. I enjoyed playing through each one, getting better, finding bugs and errors that the developers overlooked and seeing how far the coding can be stretched within its boundaries. I have seen the rise of many popular games, having played the famous ‘League of legends’ since its alpha version released by riot games on October 27th 2009, and another great example is the open world sandbox survival game everyone loves, Minecraft. I have played video games over all available means, console, PC and mobile games and have found common elements that draw players in to keep playing. As the game gains popularity, another common aspect of these games is to add extra content that costs a little extra, or microtransaction throughout the game to give the player more content to enjoy, as well as supporting the development process of the game's design. Even if 1 item costs $0.99 cents, if the game has a population of 1000 players and each buys this item, the game has just made $990 US dollars profit, that can be used as a motivation for people to improve the game further.
I have always wanted to design my own game, something I can also enjoy playing and adding content as I see fit, and plan to use this opportunity to build a team that has the same view.
</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, I would like to create an open world looter based game. I would like the game to follow a storyline, to keep the player intrigued as to what will happen next, but this shouldnt be the main focus of the game itself. A looter style game focuses on the player defeatings massive waves of enemies at once, using skills and items at their leisure, some good examples of games that follow this description are Diablo (1, 2, 3) and world of warcraft, both developed by Blizzard entertainment; or the new minecraft game release: Minecraft Dungeons, developed by Mojang and Microsoft and published May 26th 2020.  Enemies drop items to improve the hero’s overall stats and allow the player to defeat more difficult enemies, and progress through the map. There will be a variety of items available for the player to find, some items will have lower drop rates than others, making them hard to find, some items should be hidden, and some dropped only by high level mobs or boss characters, to motivate the player to take on more challenges. Items should also be diverse, ranging from armour upgrades, to new weapons, healing potions or food, speed boosters and so on. Items should also be given as a reward for completing quests available all over the world. To complete quests, the player must first interact with a computer generated character, which will give a description of what whe player must do, and a glance at its available rewards, motivating the player to continue. Side quests would give less rewards, and would be easier to complete than story based quests.
<br></br>
The game world can be designed and generated in unreal engine. I have used unreal engine before to create some simple 3d environments, but have never added a character or given any real purpose. In terms of graphic style, I believe that a simple style can take a long way with the right kind of content. Realistic style games take years to design, perfect and render, as well as huge teams of designers. I want to create a simplistic, entertaining mobile app that can be enjoyed for 5 minutes or for 5 hours, where players aren't forced to continue and can leave at any moment. As a student I find that I simply do not have enough time to play games anymore, as each mission or quest takes longer than I have to relax, such as ‘league of legends’, ‘Deep rock Galactic’ or ‘Skyrim’. Idle games are just as fun and do not stress the player about their overall participation, mostly moving through the games recycled content automatically while the player does their work, and doesn't pay much attention to the ‘grinding’ aspect of the game; they are mainly interested in reaping its rewards and customising their characters, a good example of a game like this is ‘Non-Stop Knights 2’ on mobile devices. This is similar to the effect I would like to create, but without the auto-play aspect of the game. I want the players to be invested in upgrading their character to the highest level they can be, finding epic armour sets and combining them to defeat more powerful bosses.
</p>

<h3>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>The main tool that I plan on developing my game in will be the aforementioned Unreal Engine version 5, developed by Epic MegaGames. Unreal engine is a diverse and powerful game engine that can render large 3d environments, as well as create interactions between characters, generated mobs and the environment itself. Characters on the other hand cannot be created in unreal engine, but can be imported from other software exports such as the 3d modelling software Blender. For this, a powerful computer is necessary to render all of these materials together, a 64-bit processing system with at least an 8th gen intel processor, or a quad processor is preferred. Direct X 12 will increase the render quality of the environment during the creation stages, but is optional; at least 8gb of ram is required otherwise the software will not be able to run.
Some experience in 3D softwares such as blender or archicad. Archicad is better for both character animations and modelling, but blender allows for more detailed modelling, and can be imported directly and animated in unreal engine.
As the character will be interacting with other characters, accepting quests and following a story line, the members of my team and I will have to create a background story for the character to follow that's intriguing enough for the player to want to find out what will happen to their character when they reach the end. Storytelling and writing skills will come into play here, and will need to be agreed upon by each member of the team before we can start designing the game itself.
</p>

<h3>SKILLS REQUIRED</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, to create this game our team will require some experience in storytelling, as well as 3d environment creation, 3d modelling and animation. Our team should also have good communication skills, as everyone's ideas should be open to criticism as well as taken into consideration. A great game doesn't just come to mind, it has to be planned, and flow like a real story. I will need teammates who are willing to sit, discuss and scrap as many ideas as it takes before we have a real vision on what to do, and all members are in agreement and proud.
</p>

<h3>OUTCOME</h3>
<p>I would like to create a free game that is generally easy to understand and fun to interact with. So many games nowadays come with a $60 Dollar price tag, and more costs to unlock exclusive content. Games are supposed to be a fun way to spend our down time, a means of escape from the stresses of reality. I used to love playing Diablo when I was younger, grinding and farming the same bosses over and over all day to unlock exclusive weapons with ridiculously low drop rates, nowadays people just buy the best items, and if you can’t, your character won't perform as well as those who have. Microtransactions shouldn’t make a game fun, the game should be fun by default, and with an extra cost you can unlock a new map or new items, but not powerful enough to surpass players who can't afford to pay those transaction fees.
<br></br>
My dream is to create a video game that anyone can play for free, interact with one another and show off their new items that they have wired hard to collect, and can discuss parts of their story line together, and how they feel about their characters in this virtual world, and debate possible endings to the story they are following.
<br></br>
</p>
    <br></br>

<h2>Peer feedback</h2>
  <h4> Feedback 1 - Gary Nguyen Anh Kiet: </h4>
    <p><i> “I like that we have the same issue within the gaming industry, which is the issue of microtransaction, I believe adding a real life example of how microtransaction caused a game publisher/developer to receive negative feedback from the community such as EA getting backlash from their game Star wars Battlefront 2 ,  Fifa or another publisher called 2K that included heavy microtransactions to enjoy the game of NBA2k. I believe adding one of these examples can further strengthen your argument of your issue with microtransactions and help readers understand the issue with them, as some people cannot afford microtransactions and therefore have to play for example 40+ hours just to unlock 1 fun feature because in order to unlock that feature with microtransaction it would require definitely more than .99 cents such as 50+$. Also because it is an online game, maybe add small features talking about things like how many people can a server hold, or if someone develops cheats how will you handle that issue.
      <br></br> As someone who enjoys looting games as well i guess out of curiosity i would also wonder how will the character creation be and how much control will players have as it seems that in type genre of game a lot of people like to spend a lot of type designing their character in order to look different than others and have a sense of self identity when playing the game.”
    </p></i>
    <h4> Feedback reflection </h4>
    <p>I agree with the fact that looter style games require a large variety of customisation options to allow the player to create a deeper connection with their character. Games like Skyrim, Diablo 3 and World of Warcraft give you the option to customise most aspects of your character during its creation, such as species (human, orc, goblin, khajiit, etc),  fighting class, gener, skin tone and so on. Creating a character as close to the players personal image can help them to become more      invested in the character themselves, and be willing to play more to further improve themselves. It is also a reflection on their personal identity, and the people they play with will recognise them from computer generated characters as well as other players on the map.
      In regards to using EA as a prime example of microtransactions, that could not be more accurate. For years EA has pushed microtransactions into their games, hiding new features and even multiplayer availability behind these costs. I think it is completely unfair for one of the world's largest video game producers to add these transactions, after their games already hold a heavy price tag.
      I would use this feedback to improve my description of the current state of video game design, and how large corporations use every aspect of their game to increase their income, even when it doesn't cost them any extra money to add those option to the game, like the use of online play options.

<h2> Research Questions - IT technologies </h2>
  <h4> Ai Machine Learning </h3>
    <h3>What is AI machine learning</h3>
      <p> AI machine learning describes machine technology that is able to learn from its experiences, and improve its programming itself in order to make itself more efficient. The main research goal behind this technology is to allow computers to learn and improve themselves automatically. The process is started when a program is given direct instructions to interact with its environment, but the program is also given the ability to look for the patterns of interaction, and edit its own interaction instructions in order to make more efficient decisions in the future. However, computers do not understand human language in terms of their own programming. Insted, a new algorithm has been created based on semantic analysis, that allows the program to mimic, and understand the meaning of text, and therefore define its environment in a way for the programmers to understand. This development in technology is huge, as for the first time it allows programmers to understand how the program scans, defines and adapts to objects and opticals in its environment.
      <br></br>A leading example of Ai machine learning can be seen at the Boston Dynamics robotic research and design company, founded in 1992 by Marc Railbert. Researchers at this institution have created the world's leading robot in machine learning, The Atlas robot with support and funding from The U.S Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The Atlas is a robotic construction that bears some resemblance to a man, it has a torso, 2 arms and 2 legs. Its head is made up of 1 180 degree sensor camera, and is coupled with object tracking and identification software. Atlas has been given primary environmental interaction instructions by its creator, but also has the ability to adapt its software to learn from its interactions, and become more efficient, mobile and diverse. Most recently, Atlas has completed a running obstacle course, where it has successfully maneuvered suntable terrain, used its ability to jump across spaces to large to step, and identify and pick up certain objects in its environment.
      <br></br>On the other hand, Machine learning has also been used in video games since the time of Atari 2600’s early release titles such as “Computer space” and “Pong”. With the use of machine learning, the programs Ai is able to learn from the players' decisions, and adapt. This can make for more intense video game styles, as the computer will adapt to counter the player's attack style, improve itself and as a result make the gameplay exceptionally harder.
      <br></br>Ai machine learning is also seen being implemented into the industrial industry, where automated robots have begun to replace human workers. This is especially prevalent in automobile production, such as nyTonomy and AutoX, as well as aerospace technology production industries, like The Boeing company and the Thales group. Workers are replaced by automated learning robots, programmed to interact with materials and complete the construction of products, mainly because the robots are stronger, more efficient, cheaper to maintain, and can work for longer hours with no expense to the company apart from maintenance.
      <br></br>On the other hand, we also see Ai technology being used in the data processing industry. Processing companies will use Ai learning programs to analyze and process huge amounts of data in a more unbiased, efficient manner than human employees would be capable of. </p>

    <h3> Likley societal impacts </h3>
      <p> There are a number of overwhelmingly positive ways that Ai machine learning can impact modern human society. It has the potential to transform our industries including healthcare, services, education, transport, entertainment and even food production. Today, Ai learning automation already exists in large scale production companies such as automobile and aerospace technology production companies, taking over repetitive and dangerous tasks, increasing the available human work force that we are better equipped for, such as creativity and empathy towards others.
        <br></br>In the video game industry, Ai learning allows for more challenging tasks and unpredictable enemy characters for players to face. One of the main problems video games have faced in the past is repetition. Many games take place solely online, where players interact with each other in an unpredictable environment, leaving story campaigns and computer generated aspects of the game to feel repetitive and less entertaining. With the use of new computer learning technologies, computer generated games will become less predictable the longer you play, making story based games more entertaining, and harder to play.
        <br></br>One of today's biggest leaders in Machine learning is Tesla. Founded by Elon Musk, Tesla is an automobile production company that focuses on producing electric vehicles, and researching electrical storage capabilities. Tesla is also leading research in Autonomous vehicles, and has implemented some basic functions into some of its newest models, such as the ‘Model S’ and ‘Model X’, that allow the driver to sit back, and relax while the car drives them to their destination automatically. The car follows the route via gps location, but is able to track and identify objects around it, making it able to react to unpredictable road situations in order to keep its occupants safe. </p>

    <h3> Effects on my reality </h3>
    <p>I believe that Ai machine learning will have a great impact on my reality. Today, I can purchase myself a robotic pet, such as the Cozmo robot designed by Anki robotics, that is able to interact and communicate basic reactions to its owner, as well as react to changes in its surroundings. This technology was unheard of 10 years ago and is a great example of how machine learning is becoming more and more prevalent within normal society.
      <br></br>Products that are produced using adaptive Ai robotic technology are gradually becoming cheaper, such as cars, as the production company pays less wages to workers who work in the construction process, and loses less money on the production, making modern technologies more accessible to communities who may have not been able to afford them in the past. The incorporation of new leading technologies in Ai advancement may also become the norm for cars, implementing self-driving technologies and automation to not only make life easier and more efficient for the consumer, but also as an extra level of security and safety. Automated cars will be connected to servers inherently to give them access to GPS and highway information to make driving possible, but they can also communicate with other autonomous vehicles across these networks. This would drastically increase road safety, as millions are killed in car accidents, as well as alcohol or drug related incidents that increase the chances of crashing your car, Ai technologies will always work at 100% and their efficiency is not affected the same way that humans can be affected. As previously mentioned, these autonomous cars can also communicate with each other, further decreasing the risk of collisions and fatalities on the road.
      <br></br>Games that I have played that incorporate the use of Ai mechanics when generating and controlling enemy mobs to defeat have become more entertaining, as the gameplay itself feels less repetitive and I am forced to make new decisions to counter a stronger Ai enemy that is adapting to my actions.

    <h4> Cloud Computing Technology </h4>
      <h3>What is Cloud Computing Technology  </h3>
        <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as data, software and server storage over the internet. This is a game changer for the gaming industry as it allows for games to run on remote servers, shifting a significant amount of processing power from the users device to the cloud server, meaning that in today's age, you can play powerful games, regardless of whether you have the most powerful, up to date hardware or not. This also allows devices to read and use files from the cloud itself, and they won't need to be downloaded directly to the user's device, allowing for extremely fast download times. As the cloud is developed in upcoming years, it is safe to assume that as internet speeds increase, the capacity and efficiency of the cloud servers will increase with it. Allowing for most of our apps to be stored online, and only software information to be stored on hardware devices, allowing for access and communication to cloud servers. In today's time, it is easy to reach maximum storage capacity on our personal devices as we store a lot of data on them; such as photos, music, personal information and application data. If the majority of this data apart from personal information could be stored on cloud servers, our personal devices would have a virtually limitless capacity (maybe with some cloud storage purchases), and our devices will no longer slow down with the more applications we install.
          <br></br>A great example of cloud technology is DropBox, a cloud based file server released 11th september 2008 by Dropbox, inc. Dropbox is a web based cloud server where anyone can create an account for free and store up to 2gbs worth of free data, higher capacities can be purchased by the user if necessary. As dropbox is a web based product, it can be accessed anytime anywhere using any personal device and network connection. Dropbox also zips large files and  encrypts the information to protect work from cyber based attacks. Dropbox is an especially useful tool for freelancers and as mentioned in my student report, I work as a freelance photographer. When I have to transfer a large amount of information as image data to clients, dropbox is usually the way to go. It allows me to save high definition images at a low capacity, my clients can be added to the specific dropbox folder i have added the images to and can download them to their devices with ease, this has been especially useful during the covid-19 induced lockdowns over the course of 2020 and 2021.
          </p>

      <h3> Likley societal Impacts </h3>
        <p> Cloud computing has a number of different impacts on society, and will continue to impact us as the technology develops and evolves. Our societies will start to see faster average internet speeds and  increased storage capacity and capabilities across all devices. As we begin to store more and more of our data and information on cloud servers, our dependency on the internet and global networks will increase exponentially. As more of humanity's collective knowledge and data is moved into a digital storage medium, new safeguards and protection software will need to be created in order to prevent a catastrophic global loss of information in the event of a system wide error, file data corruption or through cyber attacks such as virus implementation. </p>

      <h3> Effects on My reality </h3>
      <p> As I work as a freelance photographer, it is essential for me to be able to store, share and transfer high resolution image files between my devices and clients I am employed by. With new and improving cloud technologies, transferring files between devices as well as sharing with external user accounts has never been easier.
        I am also able to download new released video games and enjoy the high resolution graphics, even without a top end PC. Cloud servers allow games to communicate information with devices over the network, ths means that more of the games data can be read from the cloud server rather than downloaded directly onto the device, exponentially increasing download speeds, and conserving the devices CPU memory to focus on its functional playback.

<h2> The IT world </h2>

<h4> Computer programmer </h4>
  <p>Programming professionals write and test computer code, repaire, maintain and update code to create software to perform specific functions for clients to use within their organisation. Programmers are responsible for all usable software and have created a diverse range of applications to complete a wide variety of tasks and increase workflow efficiency within every industry, such as emulation programs. Emulation programs are created as a means of storing and visualising vast amounts of essential information to the organisation's function, and can be accessed and understood easily by its employees, for example: Hospitals produce and store huge amounts of information during their operation regarding their staff, available medicine and patient information. This information is inputted and edited by staff members, and can be accessed by anyone within their department.
    <br></br>The programs that have been developed by computer programmers have helped to change the way people interact with the world around them, and will continue to develop new technologies to further improve human life style, such as cloud technology and AI automation as previously discussed.
    <br></br>Computer programmers normally work alone, as writing the code they write must be consistent, and a single mistake could break the whole program. Because of this, coding can be a very tedious process and large projects normally require a lot of work. On large scale projects, programmers work with other computer specialists in order to split the workload. Many professional programmers work in office corporations, in clean, dedicated working environments. Working within a corporation will help to provide clients with steady amounts of workflow as well as a steady salary. Programmers that work in these environments normally work full 40-hour work weeks, putting in extra over time to fix technical problems if necessary.
    <br></br>Programmers will often work with designers within their corporation department, in order to create a blueprint for the intended software, its delivered user experience, and eliminate any flaws within their design plan, before they begin the coding process. Programmers may also work directly with clients to resolve more specific issues with software design functionality, as well as technical errors and software maintenance within the workplace.
    <br></br>Freelancing has become a popular trend amongst aspiring computer programmers, as new technologies allow them to work efficiently from home, as well as moving their work from one place to another more easily via new hardware technologies or through secure cloud networks to meet clients, or to preview their projects to potential buyers. Freelancers work on their own time, completing projects by themselves, within a timeframe agreed upon with their client. Making money through freelance work is harder for computer programmers, as they have to design all aspects of the program, as well as seek out clients themselves.
    <br></br>Programmers spend the majority of their time in front of their computer terminals, as creating and maintaining software can take a very long time. Programmers that work within large corporations such as Google, work as long as 40 hour weeks, not including overtime. In recent years, programmers that work remotely have become more popular, as new technologies allow for them to receive and transfer information more efficiently than ever before, and more people are choosing to work from home.
    <br></br>Computer programmers face a variety of challenges when developing new software programs and applications for clients. One of the largest problems they face is understanding the needs of the customer or end user of the program. Developers who write programs for corporations become responsible for how their employees interact with the software and as a result their workflow efficiency. The needs of the end user can be hard to translate to a software developer, especially as the programmer relies on end user feedback provided by user research during the project's prototype development and user research and testing stages. To overcome these challenges, programmers work closely with user interface (UI), as well as User experience (UX) designers, to develop the most efficient and understandable end product possible.
    <br></br>Becoming a programmer takes years of dedicated study and understanding of computer sciences, and the access to jobs within their field of study can be extremely hard to come by, a survey conducted on 1/50,000 engineers in India revealed that while 97% wished to work in core engineering or software engineering, just 3% possessed the programming skills required for employability in the software sector. These scenarios are changing rapidly in modern society, as networking and computing technologies develop, skills can be taught online and accessed by the online global community, giving normal people the ability to teach themselves skills required to perform at a higher capacity within these industries, including the software sectors discussed above.
    <br></br>As the development of computer programs and software is an ongoing process, the constant updating of knowledge is necessary to perform in this field. Programmers have to constantly create new design frameworks as well as updated programming languages and libraries, in order to bring clients to the best end product possible. If programmers do not update their existing knowledge, they will stagnate as their industry continues to develop, and they will lose their competitive edge necessary for better paying jobs.

<h4> User Experience (UX) Designer</h4>
<p>User experience designers are responsible for the research, collection, investigation and evaluation of the user requirements that must be taken into account whilst designing digital software or websites. They work closely with software and website designers, carrying the main responsibility to deliver outstanding user experience while interacting with their product, and providing exceptional insight into user interactive application design.
  <br></br>Ui/Ux designers participate in all 5 phases of the design thinking and planning process. They contribute toward all parts of the design process, keeping in mind the intricacies of user interaction, and how the design may be experienced by the user base. In large companies, a UI/UX designer typically works with other designers such as User researchers, web developers and visual designers, to produce the most practical and aesthetically pleasing design to showcase to clients, and ensuring the user experience of the final product will always be pleasant.
  <br></br>UI/UX designers normally work in office environments within their corporation and work with other designers in order to complete projects that are given by their working superiors, spending the majority of their working hours either meeting with clients, or working on their design projects in front of their own computer terminals. Clients will contact the corporation, asking for a product, such as a mobile application page, to represent their business. The corporation then hands down client projects to its designers, and are paid a salary depending on the amount of work they do and how long the project takes to complete (clients normally pay more money for jobs that take a short time but produce high quality work).
  <br></br>However, with modern advancements in technology it is becoming increasingly easy for UI/UX designers to work remotely. Advancements in cloud computing technology allows for large quantities of digital information to be stored and accessed through cloud servers, allowing Ui/UX designers to transfer work between devices and locations with ease, as well as sharing their work with clients from remote locations. This has caused more Ui/UX designers to start working remotely or from home, rather than in an office environment. Ui/UX designers who choose to work remotely may face a larger workload compared to those who work in office environments, as they will be tasked with finding clients, as well as planning, prototyping, testing and creating the entire product.
  <br></br>There are many challenges that Ui/Ux designers face when completing projects, one of the most prominent being imposed by the company itself, every work environment has a variation in culture, organisation, workflow or methodology. Designers' productivity may be affected by external factors present in their environment, low access to data with low priority employee accounts and poor internal communication, leading to a lack of design cision around the products and services they are trying to provide for clients. Freelance designers who decide to work remotely will often face network related problems. Online remote work requires a high-speed network connection, to communicate effectively with clients and collaborators, as well as sending and receiving files. Ui/Ux designers also collect and analyse user feedback given by user research collaborators, and communicate changes in design to development, with justifications to prove why those changes are appropriate. Information that is collected from a variety of different collaborating sources can potentially contradict one another, it is the responsibility of the Ux designer to resolve these contradictions and highlight relevant feedback to be taken under advisement by the project developers.
  <br></br>Working with and collaborating with other developers can also present a number of challenges for Ui/Ux designers to overcome. Ui/Ux designers normally work with visual design softwares such as figma or adobe XD, but developers may prefer to use computer language code instead, this can lead to come misunderstandings within the design team, as developers try to copy Ui/Ux designers prototype wireframes, and cannot code the website exactly how it it has been planned, and the responsibility of the Ui/Ux designer to bring potential translation issues to the attention of code developers.

<h4> Network Engineer</h4>
  <p>A network engineer develops and maintains computer networks, hardware, software and any other system related to the operation of a network. This can mean anything from setting up one internet connection, to developing multiple computer networks within an organisation or between multiple organisations. Network engineers also perform disaster recovery operations in the event of network corruption or failure, protecting data, hardware and software from cyber attacks. Network engineers also replace faulty hardware components when necessary to optimise network speeds.
  <br></br>Network engineers will work in-house (within the organisation that hires them) or be assigned to project management teams working with clients outside of their organisation. As part of a single organisations IT team, network engineers work closely with business analysts, network architects and IT managers, helping to maintain and maximise network performance through ongoing monetization and troubleshooting. Network engineers are the heart of the technological realm, creating networks that include a local area network (LAN connections), wide area networks (WAN connections), internet and extranets. The network complexity that they develop can vary depending on the organisation they are working within. Small organisations may have a small team or one dedicated network engineer maintaining their network, global corporations will have multiple network engineers that work together from different sides of the world, in order to share their collective data. Engineers that work together over a global network will always report to a chief technological officer, who will be responsible for the global network’s operation as a whole.
  <br></br>Network engineers typically work in an office environment, monitoring and maintaining the network connections to maximise traffic. Most specialize in network management for a single company, and contain their work within that organisation, other work to create new network connections between organisations and for public access. As humanity has moved more of its resources into the digital realm, there is a higher demand for readily available network connections for people to access information and communicate across, network engineers responsible for these connections normally work within third party organisations, such as network providers. Occasionally, network engineers will outsource their services to multiple businesses. In this case, the network engineers might travel regularly to visit individual business locations.
  <br></br>As a network engineer, a good quality, fast working network connection is an essential tool to complete their work, network engineers that are faced with poor network connections find it harder to complete their tasks and maintain the network as there is more traffic coming from all directions. Without the right tools at each end and midpoint, it is almost impossible to provide a high-speed network connection that is required by most modern applications. However, it isn’t solely high speed performance, the network itself needs to be reliable and designed to handle large spikes in traffic load. If the network fails, the entire business may go offline and production will stop. Another top challenge faced by network engineers is network security. As cyber attacks become more sophisticated, it has become inadequate to just block unauthorized external traffic. For example, a denial of service attack (DOS) only needs to attempt to connect to the network in order to succeed in order to take the system offline. Network traffic can be encrypted to prevent these cyber attacks, but encrypting network data can make it more difficult to monitor the network activity.
  <br></br>As networks increase in size, network engineers must also configure the network to accommodate more data, the larger a network grows, the harder it becomes to calibrate. Devices can cause conflicts between one another, and keeping the rules of firewalls upto date can become increasingly difficult, as device policies for protection must be applied manually, one by one. This process can take a long time and is often subject to mistakes. All of these factors would stay the same if the network stayed the same size. However, there is a constant increase in the number of devices attached to the network, with every new connection adding a potential point for failure.

<h4> IT Technician </h4>
  <p>An IT technician maintains the computer network systems within an organisation. Their main duties include troubleshooting and diagnosing computer hardware and software issues experienced by employees within the organisation. It technicians are responsible for the set up of hardware, the installation of software and the maintenance of the networks used within the organisation, as well as assisting employees and customers with IT- related problems. IT technicians are hired to work within a single organisation, and are responsible for all IT-related aspects of their organisation, including the security and privacy of the network and computer systems used by the corporation. IT specialists are similar to IT technicians, but usually work to help companies overcome large scale IT issues and installations.
  <br></br>IT technicians are often employed by a single organisation, to help troubleshoot and resolve IT related issues with hardware, software or networking technology that may be experienced by faculty members of that organisation, or its customers. If the organisation invests in new or updated versions of their existing hardware, software, or networking technology to increase its workflow efficiency, the responsibility of installing / updating as well as maintaining these new tools will fall directly on the company's internal IT technician / department across the entire organisation. The IT department will work closely with the leaders of the organisation, keeping them informed on the efficiency of the network and state of their data architecture, bringing any concerns directly to them, as well as aiding the main user’s of said technologies, in order to give basic instruction on how to use the tools in a safe, efficient manner.
  <br></br>It technicians may also work for a third party technological organisation, that assigns them to work on project assignments for external clients that have hired the services of their company. These IT technicians work within project dedicated teams to install large scale hardware, software or network server projects for large organisations or events, such as music festivals, and work with other technicians or designers that have been assigned to that project, until the project ends and they are assigned to a new project.
  <br></br>As IT technicians work within most existing organisations, their work can be seen in a variety of different work environments including businesses, government offices, schools, hospitals, Non-profit organisations as well as within third party IT and computer support services, such as call centres. The roles and responsibilities of an IT technician will change depending on the environment they are working in, as well as the nature of interaction with their colleagues, for example: an IT technician who works as a customer support agent for a tech support company won't have a huge role within their organisation, their job is to collect calls from customers, and support them with technical issues they are experiencing. On the other hand, an IT technician that works in an educational environment such as a high school will have the responsibility of setting up and/or maintaining a network server, as well as all the implementing and maintaining usable hardware and installing up to date software to be used by both the students and teachers within that school.
  <br></br>A number of problems have risen for IT technicians to face with the development of modern technology, one of the biggest problems being caused by this continued development itself. Globally, an estimated 155% of skills gaps increased within the IT technological field itself. As new technologies are released for commercial use, IT technicians must adapt to new hardware and software in order to keep their organisations workflow at maximum capacity, as well as keeping their own knowledge and skill level within their field from stagnating.
  <br></br>With a higher number of the global population becoming skilled within the technological field, the number of cyber attacks and security threats that pose risk to large corporations that depend on their network servers to store information have increased too, with the size and sophistication of cyber attacks increasing with them. However, millions of cyber security jobs remain unfilled, and an average of only 40% of technical teams stationed across the United States reported having cyber security expertise within their organisations. With the right training methods, IT technicians could easily transition to keeping their networks secure using cyber security methods, but the training is still yet to be implemented to a number of major corporations.
