    <h2> Team Profile </h2>
    <p><b>Team name</b><br></br>
      A team's name should be a reflection of its members, as well as the product we intend to create, and should be discussed and decided once each team member is happy to agree. No one wants to be a part of a team they are embarrassed to say the name of.
      <br></br><b> Team Profile</b><br></br>
      I believe that any good team requires open and honest communication between its members and everyone should be able to openly communicate their ideas, participate in discussions regarding the project itself and be open to constructive criticism as a means of improving the concept into a workable plan. Team members should co-operate and assume roles they are comfortable with, if they wish to learn a skill, they should not assume the full responsibility of that role, but rather a supporting role to gain a gist of how that role would work, and ask questions of interest to the member of our team who has assumed that role, this means that the next time the opportunity arises, this team member will have full knowledge of the requirements of that position, and prepared for all of the responsibilities that come with it. Our team should be made up of members with a variety of these skill sets. Not one person can be amazing at every aspect of a project, and that's okay! As long as any concerns are brought to the attention of the group, there will always be a member who is experienced in what we need done. Team members should make their skills known within our team, as well as any areas they may be lacking in. This way our team can formulate a plan, and distribute work to each member that can be completed to a high standard.
There are many aspects of work to consider when taking on a project, and a lot of the time this work goes unnoticed, such as the planning and improvement stages of the project. For any high quality product, there is a quality plan supporting it. Having a consistent workflow through the project is extremely important. No part of the project should be easy and laid back, from the planning process to the end presentation, every part should be taken as seriously as the next. I would like to form a team that understands this and agrees. During my time at RMIT I have been teamed with teams that fall into this trap, and as a result our projects didn't perform as well as I would have hoped.<br></br>
When I undergo any project, I tend to throw myself into it, thinking about it constantly until I am completely satisfied with its outcome. I want to create something that I can be proud of and would want to showcase to clients. Every member of the team should feel this way about a project, and have the confidence to stand up and present our work to everyone.
Last but not least, I would like my team members to be friendly. We don't need to be friends, but it's okay to be friendly and supportive, making sure your teammates are not over stressed and can contribute their best.

    <h2> Project Idea </h2>
    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<p>For my project I would like to create a character driven looter style video game, made for mobile devices and can be understood by players aged 7 and above. A looter style game consists of a hero character, controlled by the player, that progresses through different maps and defeating different enemies to gain new weapons and armour, and subsequently will be able to defeat more powerful enemy characters. I would like this game to hold an ‘open world’ game style, where the player isn't forced to follow any certain path, but instead can travel anywhere at any time and complete different side quests as well as following a main story quest. To complete quests, the player must first interact with a computer generated character, which will give a description of what whe player must do, and a glance at its available rewards, motivating the player to continue. Side quests would give less rewards, and would be easier to complete than story based quests.
</p>

<h3>MOTIVATION</h3>
<p>As previously discussed in assignment 1, I have spent the majority of my childhood entertaining myself with all kinds of video games. I enjoyed playing through each one, getting better, finding bugs and errors that the developers overlooked and seeing how far the coding can be stretched within its boundaries. I have seen the rise of many popular games, having played the famous ‘League of legends’ since its alpha version released by riot games on October 27th 2009, and another great example is the open world sandbox survival game everyone loves, Minecraft. I have played video games over all available means, console, PC and mobile games and have found common elements that draw players in to keep playing. As the game gains popularity, another common aspect of these games is to add extra content that costs a little extra, or microtransaction throughout the game to give the player more content to enjoy, as well as supporting the development process of the game's design. Even if 1 item costs $0.99 cents, if the game has a population of 1000 players and each buys this item, the game has just made $990 US dollars profit, that can be used as a motivation for people to improve the game further.
I have always wanted to design my own game, something I can also enjoy playing and adding content as I see fit, and plan to use this opportunity to build a team that has the same view.
</p>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, I would like to create an open world looter based game. I would like the game to follow a storyline, to keep the player intrigued as to what will happen next, but this shouldnt be the main focus of the game itself. A looter style game focuses on the player defeatings massive waves of enemies at once, using skills and items at their leisure, some good examples of games that follow this description are Diablo (1, 2, 3) and world of warcraft, both developed by Blizzard entertainment; or the new minecraft game release: Minecraft Dungeons, developed by Mojang and Microsoft and published May 26th 2020.  Enemies drop items to improve the hero’s overall stats and allow the player to defeat more difficult enemies, and progress through the map. There will be a variety of items available for the player to find, some items will have lower drop rates than others, making them hard to find, some items should be hidden, and some dropped only by high level mobs or boss characters, to motivate the player to take on more challenges. Items should also be diverse, ranging from armour upgrades, to new weapons, healing potions or food, speed boosters and so on. Items should also be given as a reward for completing quests available all over the world. To complete quests, the player must first interact with a computer generated character, which will give a description of what whe player must do, and a glance at its available rewards, motivating the player to continue. Side quests would give less rewards, and would be easier to complete than story based quests.
<br></br>
The game world can be designed and generated in unreal engine. I have used unreal engine before to create some simple 3d environments, but have never added a character or given any real purpose. In terms of graphic style, I believe that a simple style can take a long way with the right kind of content. Realistic style games take years to design, perfect and render, as well as huge teams of designers. I want to create a simplistic, entertaining mobile app that can be enjoyed for 5 minutes or for 5 hours, where players aren't forced to continue and can leave at any moment. As a student I find that I simply do not have enough time to play games anymore, as each mission or quest takes longer than I have to relax, such as ‘league of legends’, ‘Deep rock Galactic’ or ‘Skyrim’. Idle games are just as fun and do not stress the player about their overall participation, mostly moving through the games recycled content automatically while the player does their work, and doesn't pay much attention to the ‘grinding’ aspect of the game; they are mainly interested in reaping its rewards and customising their characters, a good example of a game like this is ‘Non-Stop Knights 2’ on mobile devices. This is similar to the effect I would like to create, but without the auto-play aspect of the game. I want the players to be invested in upgrading their character to the highest level they can be, finding epic armour sets and combining them to defeat more powerful bosses.
</p>

<h3>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>The main tool that I plan on developing my game in will be the aforementioned Unreal Engine version 5, developed by Epic MegaGames. Unreal engine is a diverse and powerful game engine that can render large 3d environments, as well as create interactions between characters, generated mobs and the environment itself. Characters on the other hand cannot be created in unreal engine, but can be imported from other software exports such as the 3d modelling software Blender. For this, a powerful computer is necessary to render all of these materials together, a 64-bit processing system with at least an 8th gen intel processor, or a quad processor is preferred. Direct X 12 will increase the render quality of the environment during the creation stages, but is optional; at least 8gb of ram is required otherwise the software will not be able to run.
Some experience in 3D softwares such as blender or archicad. Archicad is better for both character animations and modelling, but blender allows for more detailed modelling, and can be imported directly and animated in unreal engine.
As the character will be interacting with other characters, accepting quests and following a story line, the members of my team and I will have to create a background story for the character to follow that's intriguing enough for the player to want to find out what will happen to their character when they reach the end. Storytelling and writing skills will come into play here, and will need to be agreed upon by each member of the team before we can start designing the game itself.
</p>

<h3>SKILLS REQUIRED</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, to create this game our team will require some experience in storytelling, as well as 3d environment creation, 3d modelling and animation. Our team should also have good communication skills, as everyone's ideas should be open to criticism as well as taken into consideration. A great game doesn't just come to mind, it has to be planned, and flow like a real story. I will need teammates who are willing to sit, discuss and scrap as many ideas as it takes before we have a real vision on what to do, and all members are in agreement and proud.
</p>

<h3>OUTCOME</h3>
<p>I would like to create a free game that is generally easy to understand and fun to interact with. So many games nowadays come with a $60 Dollar price tag, and more costs to unlock exclusive content. Games are supposed to be a fun way to spend our down time, a means of escape from the stresses of reality. I used to love playing Diablo when I was younger, grinding and farming the same bosses over and over all day to unlock exclusive weapons with ridiculously low drop rates, nowadays people just buy the best items, and if you can’t, your character won't perform as well as those who have. Microtransactions shouldn’t make a game fun, the game should be fun by default, and with an extra cost you can unlock a new map or new items, but not powerful enough to surpass players who can't afford to pay those transaction fees.
<br></br>
My dream is to create a video game that anyone can play for free, interact with one another and show off their new items that they have wired hard to collect, and can discuss parts of their story line together, and how they feel about their characters in this virtual world, and debate possible endings to the story they are following.

<h2>Peer feedback</h2>
  <h4> Feedback 1 - Gary Nguyen Anh Kiet: </h4>
    <p><i> “I like that we have the same issue within the gaming industry, which is the issue of microtransaction, I believe adding a real life example of how microtransaction caused a game publisher/developer to receive negative feedback from the community such as EA getting backlash from their game Star wars Battlefront 2 ,  Fifa or another publisher called 2K that included heavy microtransactions to enjoy the game of NBA2k. I believe adding one of these examples can further strengthen your argument of your issue with microtransactions and help readers understand the issue with them, as some people cannot afford microtransactions and therefore have to play for example 40+ hours just to unlock 1 fun feature because in order to unlock that feature with microtransaction it would require definitely more than .99 cents such as 50+$. Also because it is an online game, maybe add small features talking about things like how many people can a server hold, or if someone develops cheats how will you handle that issue.
      <br></br> As someone who enjoys looting games as well i guess out of curiosity i would also wonder how will the character creation be and how much control will players have as it seems that in type genre of game a lot of people like to spend a lot of type designing their character in order to look different than others and have a sense of self identity when playing the game.”
    </p></i>
    <h4> Feedback reflection </h4>
    <p>I agree with the fact that looter style games require a large variety of customisation options to allow the player to create a deeper connection with their character. Games like Skyrim, Diablo 3 and World of Warcraft give you the option to customise most aspects of your character during its creation, such as species (human, orc, goblin, khajiit, etc),  fighting class, gener, skin tone and so on. Creating a character as close to the players personal image can help them to become more      invested in the character themselves, and be willing to play more to further improve themselves. It is also a reflection on their personal identity, and the people they play with will recognise them from computer generated characters as well as other players on the map.
      In regards to using EA as a prime example of microtransactions, that could not be more accurate. For years EA has pushed microtransactions into their games, hiding new features and even multiplayer availability behind these costs. I think it is completely unfair for one of the world's largest video game producers to add these transactions, after their games already hold a heavy price tag.
      I would use this feedback to improve my description of the current state of video game design, and how large corporations use every aspect of their game to increase their income, even when it doesn't cost them any extra money to add those option to the game, like the use of online play options.

    <h4> Cloud Computing Technology </h4>
      <h3>What is Cloud Computing Technology  </h3>
        <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as data, software and server storage over the internet. This is a game changer for the gaming industry as it allows for games to run on remote servers, shifting a significant amount of processing power from the users device to the cloud server, meaning that in today's age, you can play powerful games, regardless of whether you have the most powerful, up to date hardware or not. This also allows devices to read and use files from the cloud itself, and they won't need to be downloaded directly to the user's device, allowing for extremely fast download times. As the cloud is developed in upcoming years, it is safe to assume that as internet speeds increase, the capacity and efficiency of the cloud servers will increase with it. Allowing for most of our apps to be stored online, and only software information to be stored on hardware devices, allowing for access and communication to cloud servers. In today's time, it is easy to reach maximum storage capacity on our personal devices as we store a lot of data on them; such as photos, music, personal information and application data. If the majority of this data apart from personal information could be stored on cloud servers, our personal devices would have a virtually limitless capacity (maybe with some cloud storage purchases), and our devices will no longer slow down with the more applications we install.
<br></br>A great example of cloud technology is DropBox, a cloud based file server released 11th september 2008 by Dropbox, inc. Dropbox is a web based cloud server where anyone can create an account for free and store up to 2gbs worth of free data, higher capacities can be purchased by the user if necessary. As dropbox is a web based product, it can be accessed anytime anywhere using any personal device and network connection. Dropbox also zips large files and  encrypts the information to protect work from cyber based attacks. Dropbox is an especially useful tool for freelancers and as mentioned in my student report, I work as a freelance photographer. When I have to transfer a large amount of information as image data to clients, dropbox is usually the way to go. It allows me to save high definition images at a low capacity, my clients can be added to the specific dropbox folder i have added the images to and can download them to their devices with ease, this has been especially useful during the covid-19 induced lockdowns over the course of 2020 and 2021.
